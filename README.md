# Number Guessing Game
This number guessing game is an easy project built on Java where the player has to guess a number given in between a range. If the guessed number is right, the player wins else, loses. It also has the concept of limited attempts where the player has to guess the number within the limited attempts given. 

The UI has an input value option where the player has to enter the guessed value. After completing the given limits, if the guessed number is right, the player wins else loses. The range between the number is from 1 to 100. In addition, if the number guessed by the player is greater or less than the actual value, the application sends them an alert “Too High” or “Too Low”. Once the limited attempt is completed, the actual value is revealed.
